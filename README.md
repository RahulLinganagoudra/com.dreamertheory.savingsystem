# EntitySaver - Unity Save System Component

The `EntitySaver` component is part of a lightweight Unity saving system. It enables any GameObject to serialize and deserialize its state using attached `ISaveable` components. Each entity is uniquely identified with a persistent `EntityID`.
A lightweight save/load system for Unity that allows objects to register as saveable entities with unique persistent IDs.

## ‚ú® Features

- Assigns a unique GUID to each entity.
- Automatically gathers all `ISaveable` components on the GameObject.
- Supports saving and loading of multiple components' data.
- Editor integration with a "Generate ID" button.

## üîß Installation

#### Steps
1. Open Unity.
2. Go to Window ‚Üí Package Manager.
3. Click the + button (top-left).
4. Choose ‚ÄúAdd package from Git URL‚Ä¶‚Äù.
5. Paste the following URL:
``` bash :
https://github.com/RahulLinganagoudra/com.dreamertheory.savingsystem.git
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Add the `EntitySaver` component to any GameObject.
2. Ensure your component implements the `ISaveable` interface:
``` cs : 
   public interface ISaveable
   {
       string Save();
       void Load(string data);
   }
```
3. Each ISaveable component on the GameObject will be included in save/load operations.

### Prefab Setup Example
You can use EntitySaver on any prefab that needs to be saved/loaded. Here's a common use-case:

- Player

  - EntitySaver component
  
  - PlayerStats (implements ISaveable)
  
  - Inventory (implements ISaveable)

Each component manages its own data, while EntitySaver coordinates saving/loading.

### Example
``` cs :
public class PlayerStats : MonoBehaviour, ISaveable
{
    public int health = 100;

    public string Save()
    {
        return JsonUtility.ToJson(this);
    }

    public void Load(string data)
    {
        JsonUtility.FromJsonOverwrite(data, this);
    }
}
```
Attach EntitySaver and PlayerStats to the same GameObject.
### Saving and Loading
Use the Save() and Load() methods of EntitySaver to serialize or deserialize:
``` cs :
EntitySaver saver = GetComponent<EntitySaver>();

// Saving
var data = saver.Save();
// Store 'data' somewhere (file, PlayerPrefs, etc.)

// Loading
saver.Load(data);

```
### Editor Integration
The editor script adds a "Generate ID" button in the Inspector for the EntitySaver component.
- Use this button to assign a unique ID to the GameObject.

- Required if you want to reference this object persistently across sessions.
### Notes
The EntityID is serialized and can be generated via the button or programmatically.

Do not modify EntityID at runtime unless you know what you're doing ‚Äî it may break save data consistency.
